hackerEnv is an automation tool that quickly and easily sweep IPs and scan ports, vulnerabilities and exploit them. Then, it hands you an interactive shell for further testing. Also, it generates HTML and docx reports.
It uses other tools such as nmap, nikto, metasploit and hydra. Works in kali linux and Parrot OS.<br />
This tool was NOT coded by a professional, I do not know what i am doing.
